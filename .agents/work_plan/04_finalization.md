# Finalization Phase

This phase prepares the implementation for integration by cleaning up temporary artifacts and performing comprehensive verification.

## 10. Cleanup

- Update project documentation if the changes introduce new features, commands, or modify behavior
- Delete temporary files: `issue_background.md`, `issue_coverage.md`, `issue_plan.md`
- Commit cleanup

## 11. Manual Verification

- Create step-by-step verification script under `test/scripts/` including:
  - Installing `tako` and `takotest` CLI tools
  - Using custom cache and work directories within current folder
  - Testing both local and remote modes
  - Output verification to ensure functionality
  - This script should have a structure similar to the other scripts in that folder
  - The script should use `takotest` to setup a named test environment
- Run script in local mode until passing
- Run script in remote mode until passing
- Commit working changes

## Key Requirements

- **Clean State**: Remove all temporary development artifacts
- **End-to-End Verification**: Ensure the feature works as intended in real-world scenarios
- **Script Structure**: Follow existing conventions in the `test/scripts/` directory
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verify both local and remote operation modes
