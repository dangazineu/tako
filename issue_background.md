   - CEL filter validation
   - Template expression support in input mappings

#### 🚧 Partially Implemented (needs enhancement)
1. **CEL Evaluation and Caching**
   - Basic CEL evaluation exists but lacks caching
   - No performance optimization for repeated expressions
   - Cost limiting is in place but could be enhanced

2. **Schema Compatibility**
   - Basic semver range evaluation implemented
   - Needs enhancement for more complex compatibility scenarios
   - Could benefit from better error messaging

3. **SubscriptionEvaluator Enhancement**
   - Current implementation is functional but basic
   - Needs performance optimizations
   - Template processing is simplified

#### ❌ Not Yet Implemented (core focus of this issue)
1. **Diamond Dependency Resolution**
   - No "first-wins" logic in current subscription processing
   - Need to handle multiple subscriptions to same artifact/event
   - Must prevent duplicate workflow executions

2. **Enhanced Orchestrator Logic**  
   - Current orchestrator is a simple pass-through
   - Needs filtering, prioritization, and conflict resolution
   - Missing structured logging and monitoring integration

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - CEL expression caching
   - Subscription matching optimizations
   - Metrics and monitoring enhancements

## Architecture Context

### Integration Points
1. **FanOut Executor** (`internal/engine/fanout.go`)
   - Lines 221-494: `executeWithContextAndSubscriptions` method
   - Lines 568-766: `triggerSubscribersWithState` method  
   - Already integrated with state management from issue #134

2. **Discovery System** (`internal/engine/discovery.go`)
   - Well-established interface through `SubscriptionDiscoverer`
   - Good coverage and testing foundation

3. **Configuration System**
   - Complete subscription schema already defined
   - Validation infrastructure in place

## Diamond Dependency Challenge

### Problem Definition
When multiple repositories subscribe to the same event from the same artifact, the "first-wins" rule must be applied to prevent:
- Duplicate workflow executions
- Race conditions in processing
- Inconsistent state management

### Current Gap
The existing `FanOutExecutor.triggerSubscribersWithState` method processes all subscribers but doesn't implement first-wins conflict resolution for identical subscriptions.

### Solution Approach
Need to enhance the subscription processing to:
1. Detect duplicate subscriptions (same artifact + event + filters)
2. Apply first-wins ordering (likely based on repository path or discovery order)
3. Ensure only the winning subscription triggers workflow execution
4. Log and track skipped duplicates for observability

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance Profile
- Basic CEL evaluation: functional but unoptimized
- No expression caching leads to repeated compilation
- Schema validation repeated for each subscription

### Enhancement Opportunities  
1. **CEL Expression Caching**: Compile expressions once, reuse evaluations
2. **Subscription Matching Optimization**: Pre-filter subscriptions before detailed evaluation
3. **Schema Compatibility Caching**: Cache compatibility results for version pairs

## Testing Strategy

### Existing Test Coverage
- `SubscriptionEvaluator`: Basic functionality covered
- `Orchestrator`: Interface compliance verified  
- `FanOutExecutor`: Comprehensive test suite with idempotency
- `Discovery`: Good coverage (82.9% for core methods)

### Test Gaps to Address
1. **Diamond Dependency Scenarios**: Need comprehensive test cases
2. **CEL Performance**: Load testing with complex expressions
3. **Schema Compatibility Edge Cases**: Version range boundary conditions
4. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple subscriptions processing simultaneously

## Technical Decisions (Gemini Consultation)

After consulting with Gemini on key design questions, the following decisions were made:

### Diamond Dependency Resolution
**Decision: Subscription-level first-wins**
- Target duplicate subscriptions (same filters, inputs) rather than blocking repositories
- Maintains subscription model flexibility while preventing true duplicates
- More robust and architecturally sound than repository-level blocking

### CEL Expression Caching  
**Decision: In-memory cache with LRU eviction**
- Optimal for CLI tool's short execution lifecycle
- Avoids complexity of persistent cache management
- Provides needed performance boost for current session

### Schema Compatibility Enhancement
**Decision: Extended ranges only**
- Add compound ranges like ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"  
- Pragmatic balance between functionality and complexity
- Covers vast majority of real-world use cases

### Integration with Existing Idempotency
**Decision: Extend existing fingerprinting system**
- Enhance fingerprinting to include subscription details
- Single unified deduplication system
- Leverages existing infrastructure for consistency

### Testing Priority
1. **Unit Tests** (highest) - All new complex logic
2. **Integration Tests** (high) - End-to-end diamond dependency scenarios  
3. **Performance Tests** (lower) - Caching behavior verification

### Backward Compatibility
- Changes are corrective improvements, not breaking changes
- Diamond resolution fixes undesirable duplicate behavior
- Schema validation improvements with clear error messages
- Document behavioral changes clearly

## Conclusion

This issue represents the culmination of the subscription-based triggering system. The foundation is solid with:
- Complete configuration schema ✅
- Basic evaluation infrastructure ✅  
- Idempotency and state management ✅
- Clean architecture and interfaces ✅

The core work involves:
1. **Enhancing performance** through in-memory CEL caching
2. **Implementing subscription-level diamond dependency resolution** 
3. **Extending existing fingerprinting** for unified deduplication
4. **Adding extended schema compatibility** ranges
5. **Comprehensive testing** prioritizing unit and integration tests

The implementation should focus on extending existing components rather than replacing them, maintaining backward compatibility and leveraging the strong foundation already in place.
