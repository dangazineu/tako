# Issue Background Analysis

## Issue Overview

**Issue #147**: Java BOM E2E Test Orchestration
**Current Branch**: `feature/147-add-java-bom-e2e-test`
**Status**: Nearly complete, requires minimal finishing touches

## Requirements Summary

The issue requests creating a complex end-to-end test that demonstrates fully automated Java Bill of Materials (BOM) release following an update to a core library. This validates tako's advanced orchestration capabilities.

## Current Implementation Assessment

### What's Already Implemented

1. **Complete Repository Structure**:
   - `core-lib`: Foundational Java library (triggers cascade)
   - `lib-a` & `lib-b`: Libraries depending on core-lib (consumers & publishers)
   - `java-bom`: BOM aggregator consuming lib-a and lib-b events

2. **Event-Driven Orchestration**:
   - Core-lib emits `core_library_released` events
   - Libraries subscribe to core-lib events and emit `library_released` events
   - BOM subscribes to library events and aggregates using state tracking

3. **Realistic CI Simulation**:
   - Mock GitHub server handling PR lifecycle
   - Mock CLI tools (`mock-gh.sh`, `mock-semver.sh`)
   - Complete PR workflow: create → wait for CI → merge → continue

4. **Fan-In Coordination**:
   - BOM uses `tako.state.json` to track which libraries have released
   - Only triggers BOM creation when both libraries are ready
   - Follows the architectural pattern we agreed on (event updates + explicit coordination)

5. **E2E Test Framework**:
   - Test case `java-bom-fanout` exists and executes
   - Currently verifies core-lib release works
   - Infrastructure ready for complete verification

### What Needs Completion

1. **Orchestrator Pattern**: Need to add orchestrator-controlled timing rather than individual triggers
2. **Complete Chain Verification**: Test currently only verifies core-lib, needs to verify full chain
3. **Final Integration**: Ensure all 4 repositories participate and complete successfully

- Mock infrastructure setup and debugging
- E2E test framework improvements
- CI pipeline optimizations

### Repository Template Analysis

Current templates in `test/e2e/templates/java-bom-fanout/`:

**core-lib/tako.yml**:
- Publishes JAR and emits `core_library_released` event
- Uses fan-out without `wait_for_children` (fire-and-forget)

**lib-a/tako.yml & lib-b/tako.yml**:
- Subscribe to core-lib events
- Create PRs for dependency updates
- Wait for CI, merge PRs, then trigger own releases
- Emit `library_released` events

**java-bom/tako.yml**:
- Subscribes to both lib-a and lib-b events
- Uses state file to coordinate fan-in
- Creates BOM update PR and releases when ready

## Integration Points

### Existing Features Leveraged
1. **Event System**: Complete event emission and subscription system
2. **Fan-Out Step**: `tako/fan-out@v1` for event distribution
3. **Template Engine**: Variable substitution in workflows
4. **Mock Infrastructure**: GitHub API simulation for testing
5. **E2E Framework**: Test orchestration and verification system

### Architecture Alignment
The implementation follows the architectural insight we documented:
- **Event Subscriptions** → Update dependencies (reactive)
- **Explicit Invocation** → Control releases (orchestrated)

This eliminates the need for complex fan-in primitives while maintaining proper coordination.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Fan-In Strategy
**Decision**: Use manual state file (`tako.state.json`) rather than native fan-in primitives
**Rationale**: Aligns with our architectural understanding that BOMs update reactively but release explicitly
**Implementation**: BOM tracks library events and only proceeds when all required libraries have reported

### 2. Mock Infrastructure
**Decision**: Complete mock GitHub server rather than simplified stubs
**Rationale**: Provides realistic CI simulation including PR lifecycle and timing
**Implementation**: HTTP server with endpoints for PR management and CI status

### 3. Version Management
**Decision**: Use simple version increment (`semver -i patch`) for testing
**Rationale**: Advanced version management is enhancement for future, not blocker for core orchestration demo
**Implementation**: Mock semver tool provides predictable version increments

## Missing Pieces Analysis

### Critical for Issue 147 Completion
1. **Orchestrator Control**: Need centralized release train trigger
2. **Complete Verification**: Test must verify all 4 repositories complete
3. **End-to-End Integration**: Ensure mock infrastructure works across full chain

### Future Enhancements (Not Blocking)
1. **Advanced Version Management**: Semantic version calculation from commits
2. **Participation Control**: Opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
3. **Long-Running Steps**: State persistence and resume capability
4. **BOM Consistency**: Automated validation beyond manual updates

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Core orchestration logic is implemented and partially tested
- Mock infrastructure is functional and tested
- Event system is complete and working
- Repository templates are complete

### Medium Risk
- Full chain integration may reveal timing or sequencing issues
- Mock tools PATH and environment setup needs validation
- E2E test verification logic needs enhancement

### High Risk
None identified - the implementation is very close to completion.

## Success Criteria

### Issue 147 Complete
1. ✅ Core-lib release triggers downstream updates
2. ⏳ Lib-a and lib-b update dependencies and release
3. ⏳ Java-BOM aggregates changes and releases 
4. ⏳ All repositories verify correct versions in final state
5. ⏳ Test passes in both local and remote modes

### Future Enhancement Issues
1. Create well-defined GitHub issues for production features
2. Maintain clean separation between core demo and enhancements
3. Preserve incremental development path

## Conclusion

Issue 147 is approximately 90% complete. The core orchestration patterns, event-driven coordination, and realistic CI simulation are all implemented. The remaining work focuses on:

1. Adding orchestrator pattern for centralized control
2. Completing end-to-end verification
3. Ensuring robust integration across all components

The implementation validates that tako's architecture is sound and capable of complex orchestration scenarios. The identified "missing features" are valuable production enhancements but not blockers for the core demonstration.
