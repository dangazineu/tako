# Implementation Plan for Issue #130

## Overview
Create foundational components for subscription-based triggering system with no functional changes. The interfaces are created in a separate package to avoid circular dependencies and enable better modularity.

## Phase 1: Create Interface Package and Definitions
**Goal**: Establish the interface contracts
**Files to create**:
- `internal/interfaces/subscription.go` - Contains SubscriptionDiscoverer interface
- `internal/interfaces/workflow.go` - Contains WorkflowRunner interface

**Actions**:
1. Create `internal/interfaces` directory
2. Define `SubscriptionDiscoverer` interface with `FindSubscribers` method
3. Define `WorkflowRunner` interface with `ExecuteWorkflow` method
4. Import necessary types from engine package

**Testing**: Ensure code compiles

## Phase 2: Create Steps Package Structure
**Goal**: Establish the steps package with fanout components
**Files to create**:
- `internal/steps/fanout.go` - Contains FanOutStepExecutor, FanOutStepParams, FanOutStepResult

**Actions**:
1. Create `internal/steps` directory
2. Create `fanout.go` with basic structure
3. Define `FanOutStepParams` struct (will be populated later)
4. Define `FanOutStepResult` struct (will be populated later)
5. Define `FanOutStepExecutor` struct with interface dependencies

**Testing**: Ensure code compiles

## Phase 3: Extract Types from Engine Package
**Goal**: Move FanOutParams and FanOutResult to steps package
**Files to modify**:
- `internal/engine/fanout.go` - Remove FanOutParams and FanOutResult
- `internal/steps/fanout.go` - Add FanOutStepParams and FanOutStepResult

**Actions**:
1. Copy `FanOutParams` from engine to steps as `FanOutStepParams`
2. Copy `FanOutResult` from engine to steps as `FanOutStepResult`
3. Update imports in engine package to use the new types
4. Ensure all references are updated

**Testing**: Run all tests to ensure no breakage

## Phase 4: Implement Interface Compliance
**Goal**: Ensure existing types implement the new interfaces
**Files to modify**:
- `internal/engine/discovery.go` - Ensure DiscoveryManager implements SubscriptionDiscoverer
- `internal/engine/runner.go` - Ensure Runner implements WorkflowRunner

**Actions**:
1. Add compile-time interface checks:
   ```go
   // Ensure DiscoveryManager implements SubscriptionDiscoverer
   var _ interfaces.SubscriptionDiscoverer = (*DiscoveryManager)(nil)
   
   // Ensure Runner implements WorkflowRunner
   var _ interfaces.WorkflowRunner = (*Runner)(nil)
   ```
2. Add any necessary method adjustments (should be minimal)
3. Add comments indicating interface implementation

**Testing**: Run all tests, check coverage

## Phase 5: Add Tests for New Components
**Goal**: Ensure new code is tested to maintain coverage
**Files to create**:
- `internal/steps/fanout_test.go` - Tests for FanOutStepExecutor

**Actions**:
1. Create test file for FanOutStepExecutor
2. Create mock implementations of SubscriptionDiscoverer and WorkflowRunner
3. Write unit tests verifying that FanOutStepExecutor correctly delegates to its dependencies
4. Ensure new tests provide adequate coverage of new code

**Testing**: Run tests, verify coverage for new code

## Phase 6: Final Integration and Documentation
**Goal**: Complete the foundational setup
**Files to modify**:
- Update any necessary imports
- Add package documentation

**Actions**:
1. Add package-level documentation for interfaces and steps packages
2. Ensure all new types have proper godoc comments
3. Run gofmt on all modified files

**Testing**: 
- Run full test suite
- Verify coverage hasn't dropped more than 1%
- Run linters

## Success Criteria
- All new packages and files created
- Code compiles without errors
- All tests pass
- Coverage remains within acceptable range (â‰¥75.8%)
- No functional changes to existing behavior
- New code has adequate test coverage
