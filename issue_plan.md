# Issue #132 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Wire up the `tako/fan-out@v1` step to use the Orchestrator for discovery mechanism, ensuring proper logging of discovered subscriptions.

## Phase 1: Create Orchestrator instance in Runner
**Goal**: Add Orchestrator as a field in Runner struct and initialize it properly

**Tasks**:
1. Add `orchestrator *Orchestrator` field to Runner struct
2. Modify NewRunner to create and inject Orchestrator with DiscoveryManager
3. Update all NewRunner call sites if needed
4. Add tests for Runner initialization with Orchestrator

**Testing**: 
- Ensure all existing runner tests pass
- Add test to verify Orchestrator is properly initialized

## Phase 2: Modify executeFanOutStep to use Orchestrator
**Goal**: Call Orchestrator.DiscoverSubscriptions and log discovered subscriptions

**Tasks**:
1. Extract artifact from sourceRepo (format: "owner/repo:default")
2. Extract event_type from step parameters
3. Call Orchestrator.DiscoverSubscriptions with context
4. Log discovered subscriptions with appropriate detail
5. Handle errors from discovery appropriately

**Testing**:
- Add unit test for executeFanOutStep with mocked Orchestrator
- Test logging of discovered subscriptions
- Test error handling from discovery

## Phase 3: Pass discovered subscriptions to FanOutExecutor
**Goal**: Modify FanOutExecutor to accept pre-discovered subscriptions instead of discovering them itself

**Tasks**:
1. Modify FanOutExecutor.Execute to accept []interfaces.SubscriptionMatch parameter
2. Update executeFanOutStep to pass discovered subscriptions
3. Remove direct discovery call from FanOutExecutor.Execute
4. Ensure proper handling when no subscriptions found (graceful success with logging)

**Testing**:
- Test modified Execute method with various subscription scenarios
- Test no subscriptions found case (should succeed with appropriate log)
- Verify FanOutExecutor uses provided subscriptions

## Phase 4: Integration testing
**Goal**: Ensure the complete flow works end-to-end

**Tasks**:
1. Create integration test with real Orchestrator and FanOutExecutor
2. Test with various subscription scenarios
3. Verify logging output contains discovered subscriptions
4. Test error scenarios (no subscriptions, discovery errors)

**Testing**:
- Full integration test of fan-out step execution
- Verify logs contain expected subscription information
- Test coverage remains above baseline

## Phase 5: Documentation and cleanup
**Goal**: Ensure code is well-documented and clean

**Tasks**:
1. Add/update comments for modified functions
2. Update any relevant documentation
3. Ensure all tests pass with race detector
4. Run all linters and fix any issues

**Testing**:
- All tests pass: unit, integration, e2e
- Linters pass
- Coverage meets requirements

## Success Criteria
1. executeBuiltinStep correctly routes tako/fan-out@v1 to executeFanOutStep âœ“ (already done)
2. executeFanOutStep uses Orchestrator to discover subscriptions
3. Discovered subscriptions are properly logged with structured logging
4. No subscriptions found case handled gracefully with appropriate logging
5. Context properly propagated for cancellation/timeout support
6. All tests pass with good coverage
7. The fan-out step works in actual workflows

## Logging Patterns to Follow
- Use structured logging with slog.Info/Debug/Error
- Log discovered subscriptions: `slog.Info("discovered subscriptions for fan-out", "event", eventName, "count", len(subscriptions))`
- Log when no subscriptions found: `slog.Info("no subscriptions found for event, skipping fan-out", "event", eventName)`
- Log errors with context: `slog.Error("failed to discover subscriptions", "event", eventName, "error", err)`
