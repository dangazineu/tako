test(ci): add project validation tests and fix failures

This commit introduces a new test suite (all_test.go) to validate the project's health, checking for formatting, dependency consistency, and vulnerabilities.

To make these new tests pass, the following fixes were implemented:
- Formatting: Ran gofmt on tako_poc/validate_overrides.go.
- Dependencies: Executed go mod tidy to clean up the go.mod file.
- Security: Updated the Go version in go.mod to 1.24.4 to resolve a known vulnerability.
