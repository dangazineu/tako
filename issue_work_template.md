# Feature Development Work Plan Template

## Pre-Development Setup

1. **Create Feature Branch**  
     
   - Create branch using format: `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>`  
   - Switch to the new branch

   

2. **Establish Baseline**  
     
   - Run full test suite to ensure clean starting state:  
     - Run linters: go test  \-v .  
     - Run unit tests  
       - go test \-v \-race ./internal/…  
       - go test \-v \-race ./cmd/tako/…  
     - Run e2e tests go test \-v \-tags=e2e \--local ./…  
   - Record test coverage in issue\_coverage.md (read from coverage.out generated by linter\_test.go)  
   - Commit baseline coverage

## Analysis and Planning Phase

3. **Background Research**  
     
   - Gather comprehensive information about:  
     - The specific issue requirements  
     - Related previous work and dependencies  
     - Integration points with existing features  
     - Overall project architecture context  
     - Previous Pull Requests that attempted to resolve the issue at hand, or its parent issue (if any). This would be useful to understand paths that didn’t work, or previous challenges to avoid.  
   - Document findings in `issue_background.md`  
   - Commit background analysis

   

4. **Question Formulation and Resolution**  
     
   - List all technical questions and uncertainties  
   - Ask Gemini to evaluate code, designs, issue background, and your questions  
   - Review Gemini's suggestions but validate against your understanding  
   - Document your decisions and possibly new questions in the issue background doc  
   - Repeat this interaction as many times as needed until you and Gemini agree on a path forward and you have no more questions  
   - Commit updated background analysis

   

5. **Implementation Planning**  
     
   - Create detailed plan with discrete phases in `issue_plan.md`  
   - Each phase must leave codebase in healthy state (compiling \+ passing tests)  
   - Include both implementation and testing components for each phase  
   - Commit the plan

   

6. **Plan Review and Refinement**  
     
   - Ask Gemini to critique the plan, providing:  
     - Issue background documentation  
     - Relevant code and design docs  
     - The implementation plan  
   - Address Gemini's questions and integrate feedback  
   - Update plan and background as needed, repeat this step as many times as needed, until you have no questions left and you and gemini agree on the plan  
   - Commit refined plan

## Implementation Phase

7. **Phase-by-Phase Development**  
     
   - For each phase in the plan:  
     - Implement the planned changes;  
     - Repeat the following steps till no issues are found:  
       - Format the code: go fmt ./…  
       - Run linters: go test  \-v .  
       - Run unit tests  
         1. go test \-v \-race ./internal/…  
         2. go test \-v \-race ./cmd/tako/…  
       - Run e2e tests go test \-v \-tags=e2e \--local ./…  
       - Fix any failing tests  
     - Verify test coverage:  
       - Overall coverage drop ≤ 1%  
       - Individual function coverage drop ≤ 10%  
       - Add tests if needed to maintain coverage  
     - Update issue\_coverage.md with current coverage  
     - Mark phase complete in issue\_plan.md  
     - Commit phase completion

   

8. **Integration Testing**  
     
   - Once all implementation phases are completed, run comprehensive test suite:  
     - Format the code: go fmt ./…  
     - Run linters: go test  \-v .  
     - Run unit tests  
       - go test \-v \-race ./internal/…  
       - go test \-v \-race ./cmd/tako/…  
     - Run e2e tests go test \-v \-tags=e2e \--local ./…  
     - go test \-v \-tags=e2e \--remote ./…  \# Remote E2E tests  
     - `act --container-architecture linux/amd64 -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest`  \# CI simulation  
   - Fix any issues and run again until no issues are found  
   - Commit fixes

   

9. **Implementation Review**  
   - Ask Gemini to review implementation, providing:  
     - All background documentation  
     - Implementation plan  
     - Relevant tests and code  
     - Design documents  
   - If actionable feedback aligns with project goals:  
     - Add new phases to plan  
     - Return to step 7 for additional work  
   - Commit any changes

## Finalization Phase

10. **Cleanup**  
      
    - Delete temporary files: `issue_background.md`, `issue_coverage.md`, `issue_plan.md`  
    - Commit cleanup

    

11. **Manual Verification**  
    - Create step-by-step verification script under `test/scripts/` including:  
      - Installing `tako` and `takotest` CLI tools  
      - Using custom cache and work directories within current folder  
      - Testing both local and remote modes  
      - Output verification to ensure functionality  
      - This script should have a structure similar to the other scripts in that folder  
      - The script should use `takotest` to setup a named test environment  
    - Run script in local mode until passing  
    - Run script in remote mode until passing  
    - Commit working changes

## Pull Request and Integration

12. **Create Pull Request**  
      
    - Use conventional commit format for PR title  
    - Include comprehensive testing instructions  
    - Reference the issue on the last line (e.g., "Fixes \#123")

    

13. **Monitor and Fix CI**  
      
    - Wait 2 minutes, then check PR status  
    - If automated checks fail:  
      - Gather failure logs  
      - Reproduce issues locally  
      - Fix problems  
      - Run full test suite locally:  
        - Format the code: go fmt ./…  
        - Run linters: go test  \-v .  
        - Run unit tests  
          1. go test \-v \-race ./internal/…  
          2. go test \-v \-race ./cmd/tako/…  
        - Run e2e tests go test \-v \-tags=e2e \--local ./…  
        - go test \-v \-tags=e2e \--remote ./…  \# Remote E2E tests  
        - `act --container-architecture linux/amd64 -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest`  \# CI simulation  
        - Fix any issues and run again until no issues are found  
      - Commit and push fixes  
      - Repeat until all checks pass  
      - Do not exit this step until the Pull Request checks have finished and succeeded

    

14. **Completion**  
      
    - Report issue resolution once all checks pass

## Key Requirements

- **Testing**: All phases must maintain passing tests and adequate coverage  
- **Commits**: Follow Conventional Commits specification  
- **Code Quality**: All code must pass `gofmt` and linter checks  
- **Documentation**: Update README.md for any new features/commands

## Emergency Protocol

If repeating the same action multiple times without success:

1. Collect problem evidence  
2. Consult Gemini for suggestions  
3. Implement recommended solutions before proceeding
