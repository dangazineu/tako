# Manual Testing Limitations and Current State

## Important Notice

The current manual testing suite validates only the **discovery and setup phases** of the `tako/fan-out@v1` implementation. The **actual child workflow execution is not tested** due to the mocked `ExecuteChildWorkflow` method.

## What Is Actually Tested ✅

### 1. Parameter Parsing and Validation
- Valid parameter combinations (minimal and full configurations)
- Invalid parameter detection and error messaging
- Required field validation (event_type)

### 2. Repository Discovery
- Cache directory scanning mechanism
- Repository structure recognition
- Configuration file loading

### 3. Subscription Matching (Basic)
- Event type matching
- Static artifact reference matching (using placeholder values)

### 4. Integration Points
- Fan-out step registration in the runner
- Workflow parsing with fan-out steps
- Error propagation for invalid configurations

## What Is NOT Tested ❌

### 1. Core Functionality - Child Workflow Execution
- **No actual child workflows are executed**
- The `ExecuteChildWorkflow` method returns a simulated run ID
- Subscriber workflows never run, despite the test claiming success

### 2. Event-Driven Features
- Event payload generation and propagation
- Input mapping from event payload to workflow inputs
- Dynamic artifact reference matching

### 3. Synchronization Features
- `wait_for_children: true` functionality
- Timeout handling
- Concurrency limiting

### 4. Error Scenarios
- Child workflow failures
- Partial execution failures
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

### 5. Real-World Integration
- Multi-repository workflow orchestration
- Cross-repository data flow
- State management across repositories

## Why These Limitations Exist

The `ExecuteChildWorkflow` method contains a deadlock issue when attempting to execute child workflows within the same runner context. The current "fix" is a mock implementation that prevents the deadlock but also prevents actual functionality testing.

```go
// ExecuteChildWorkflow implements WorkflowRunner interface for fan-out step execution.
func (r *Runner) ExecuteChildWorkflow(ctx context.Context, repoPath, workflowName string, inputs map[string]string) (string, error) {
    // For now, create a simulated run ID to avoid deadlock
    // TODO: Implement proper child workflow execution with separate context
    runID := GenerateRunID()
    
    // In a real implementation, this would:
    // 1. Create a new runner instance for the child workflow
    // 2. Execute the workflow in the target repository  
    // 3. Return the actual run ID
    
    // For manual testing purposes, simulate successful execution
    return runID, nil
}
```

## Actual Implementation Status

### Completed ✅
- Interface definitions and structure
- Repository discovery mechanism
- Basic subscription matching
- Parameter validation
- Integration with runner (registration only)

### Not Implemented ❌
- Actual child workflow execution
- Event payload handling
- Synchronization mechanisms
- Production-ready error handling

## Recommendations for Proper Testing

1. **Fix the Deadlock Issue**: Implement proper child workflow execution with separate runner contexts or goroutines
2. **Add Output Verification**: Check for actual side effects in subscriber repositories
3. **Test Event Payloads**: Generate real event data and verify it propagates correctly
4. **Test Synchronization**: Implement and test wait-for-children functionality
5. **Remove Misleading Messages**: Update test scripts to reflect actual capabilities

## Current Production Readiness

⚠️ **WARNING**: The `tako/fan-out@v1` step is **NOT ready for production use** in its current state. While the discovery and setup phases work correctly, the core functionality of executing workflows in other repositories is not implemented.

### What Works
- Discovering repositories with subscriptions
- Validating fan-out step parameters
- Basic integration with the tako runner

### What Doesn't Work
- Actually triggering workflows in other repositories
- Any form of cross-repository orchestration
- The primary purpose of the fan-out step

## Next Steps

To make this feature production-ready:

1. Implement proper child workflow execution without deadlocks
2. Add comprehensive integration tests with real workflow execution
3. Implement event payload propagation
4. Add proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Test at scale with multiple repositories and concurrent executions

Until these issues are addressed, this implementation should be considered a **proof of concept** for the discovery phase only, not a functional fan-out implementation.
