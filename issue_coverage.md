## Test Status
- Unit tests: PASSING
- Linter tests: PASSING
- Local E2E tests: (skipped due to timeout - will run after implementation)

## Notes
- The baseline shows that fanout_state.go already exists with substantial implementation and good coverage
- Some methods like `waitForChildrenWithState` have 0% coverage, indicating they may not be fully tested yet
- The issue requires implementing idempotency to prevent duplicate workflow executions
