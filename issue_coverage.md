# Issue #133 - Test Coverage Tracking

## Baseline Coverage (Start of Implementation)

**Recorded at:** Initial baseline establishment  
**Branch:** feature/133-enable-isolated-child-workflow-execution  
**Date:** $(date)

### Test Results Status
- ✅ Linters (go test -v .)
- ✅ Unit tests ./internal/... 
- ✅ Unit tests ./cmd/tako/...
- ✅ E2E tests --local (all passed in 155.76s)

### Overall Coverage
**Total Coverage: 69.5%**

### Function-Level Coverage Highlights

#### Low Coverage Functions (requiring attention)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/cache.go:60`: newCachePruneCmd (13.3%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:14`: NewExecCmd (18.8%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:133`: handleResumeExecution (0.0%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:140`: determineRepositoryPath (0.0%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:157`: printExecutionResult (0.0%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/main.go:7`: main (0.0%)

#### Engine Package Coverage (target for this issue)
- Various functions in `internal/engine/` with good coverage (mostly 80%+)
- Key areas: runner.go, fanout.go, orchestrator.go

### Coverage Requirements for Implementation
- Overall coverage must not drop below **68.5%** (max 1% decrease)
- Individual function coverage must not drop more than 10% from baseline
- New functions must have adequate test coverage
