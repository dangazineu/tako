## Baseline Coverage

Date: 2025-07-29
Branch: feature/130-foundational-subscription-components

### Test Results Summary

#### Unit Tests
- Linters: ✅ PASSED
- Unit tests (internal): ✅ PASSED  
- Unit tests (cmd/tako): ✅ PASSED
- E2E tests (local): ⏱️ TIMEOUT (expected for baseline)

### Coverage Metrics

**Baseline Total Coverage: 76.8%**
**Current Total Coverage: 76.7%** (Phase 3 complete)
**Coverage Change: -0.1%** ✅ (within acceptable 1% threshold)

Coverage data saved in: `coverage_baseline.out`

### Phase Progress
- Phase 1: Interface Package Creation ✅
- Phase 2: Steps Package Structure ✅
- Phase 3: Type Extraction ✅
- Phase 4: Interface Compliance - In Progress

### Coverage Tracking Rules
- Overall coverage drop must not exceed 1%
- Individual function coverage drop must not exceed 10%
- Any new code must maintain or improve coverage

### Notes
- The project maintains good test coverage across all packages
- All formatting and linting checks are passing
- The codebase is in a healthy state for development
- Baseline coverage data preserved in coverage_baseline.out for comparison
- Small coverage drop due to new uncovered code (interfaces and steps packages)
