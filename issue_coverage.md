# Test Coverage Report - Issue #105 Baseline

**Date:** 2025-01-27
**Branch:** feature/105-implement-fanout-semantic-step
**Status:** Baseline coverage before implementing tako/fan-out@v1

## Overall Coverage Status

- **Total Coverage:** 72.9% (meets 70% threshold)
- **Unit Tests:** All passing (using correct package targeting)
- **Local E2E Tests:** All passing (77.85s execution time)
- **Container Integration:** All passing with Docker

## Coverage by Package

- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/internal/config`: 91.3% of statements
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/internal/engine`: 74.5% of statements  
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/internal/git`: 48.1% of statements
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/internal/graph`: 83.1% of statements
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal`: 54.8% of statements
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako`: 0.0% of statements (main functions)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/internal/errors`: 0.0% of statements (no test files)

## Test Coverage Method

Coverage calculated using: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/... ./cmd/tako/...`

This avoids circular dependency issues that occur with `./...` targeting.

## Coverage Tracking Goals

For new fan-out functionality, maintain coverage targets:
- New files should achieve >70% coverage
- Existing packages should not drop >1% overall
- Individual functions should not drop >10% coverage
- Target files for monitoring:
  - `internal/steps/fanout.go` (new)
  - `internal/engine/discovery.go` (new) 
  - `internal/engine/subscription.go` (new)

## E2E Test Results

All 13 test scenarios passed:
- graph-simple: 1.74s
- run-touch-command: 1.72s
- java-binary-incompatibility: 45.78s (longest running)
- exec-* workflows: All passing in 1-8s range
- Container integration: 0.80s
- Security integration: All passing
- Resource integration: All passing

## Notes

- E2E tests run successfully without timeout issues
- Container tests require Docker connectivity  
- All linter checks passing (gofmt, golangci-lint, govulncheck, etc.)
- Test method proven stable for measuring progress during implementation
