# Issue #105 Test Coverage Report

## Test Suite Results

### Unit Tests
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING
- **Total Coverage**: 72.9% (statements)
- **Execution Time**: 34.751s

### Local E2E Tests
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING
- **Total Test Cases**: 13 test scenarios
- **Execution Time**: 77.87s

## Key Coverage Areas

### Core Engine Components
- **Runner**: 72.0% - Main execution engine
- **State Management**: 75.0% - Execution state persistence
- **Template Engine**: 55.6% - Template processing and context
- **Container Management**: 66.7% - Containerized execution
- **Lock Manager**: 66.7% - Repository locking
- **Security Manager**: 75.0% - Security hardening
- **Resource Manager**: 100.0% - Resource quota management

### Configuration System
- **Config Loading**: 88.2% - YAML configuration parsing
- **Event System**: 87.5% - Event validation and processing
- **Subscription System**: 91.3% - Subscription validation

### Built-in Steps
- **Current Implementation**: executeBuiltinStep function has 100% coverage but only returns "not yet implemented"
- **Missing**: tako/fan-out@v1 step implementation (this issue's target)

## Areas with Lower Coverage

### CLI Commands
- **exec.go**: 18.8% - Will improve with fan-out implementation
- **handleResumeExecution**: 0.0% - Not covered in current tests
- **determineRepositoryPath**: 0.0% - Not covered in current tests

### Engine Functions
- **executeContainerStep**: 0.0% - Containerized execution needs more tests
- **getRepositoryNameFromPath**: 0.0% - Helper function not tested

### Template Functions
- **Template cache eviction**: 11.1% - LRU cache eviction logic
- **Advanced template functions**: Various conversion and utility functions

## Coverage Goals for Implementation

### Target Areas to Maintain/Improve
1. **Built-in Steps**: Implement tako/fan-out@v1 with comprehensive tests
2. **Repository Discovery**: New discovery.go file - target 90%+ coverage
3. **Subscription Evaluation**: New subscription.go file - target 90%+ coverage
4. **Event Emission**: Integration with existing event system
5. **Deep Synchronization**: DFS traversal logic with timeout handling

### Test Coverage Standards (per AIRULES.md)
- Overall coverage should not drop by more than 1% (currently 72.9%)
- Any given function should not drop by more than 10%
- New functions should aim for 90%+ coverage
- Must maintain comprehensive unit and E2E test suites

## Baseline Metrics
- **Current Overall Coverage**: 72.9%
- **Target After Implementation**: ≥71.9% (within 1% drop threshold)
- **New Components Target**: 90%+ coverage for all new files

## Test Environment Status
- **Docker Integration**: ✅ Working (containerized workflow tests passing)
- **Security Integration**: ✅ Working (all security profiles tested)
- **Resource Management**: ✅ Working (resource integration tests passing)
- **Local Environment**: ✅ Ready for development
