## Phase 2 Additions
- Added `resolveDiamondDependencies()` method with first-subscription-wins policy
- Comprehensive test coverage with `TestFanOutExecutor_resolveDiamondDependencies`
- Full integration with existing fanout execution flow
- Deterministic conflict resolution using alphabetical sorting
- Proper logging for conflict resolution decisions

## Phase 3 Additions
- Implemented CEL expression caching with thread-safe `sync.Map` storage
- Added cache size management with configurable limits (default: 1000 programs)
- Cache eviction using simple clear-all strategy for full cache scenarios
- Comprehensive test coverage including concurrent access and performance testing
- Performance improvements: 30-60x faster CEL expression evaluation with caching
- Added cache management methods: `ClearCache()`, `GetCacheStats()`

## Notes
