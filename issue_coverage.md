# Issue #145 - Test Coverage Baseline

## Baseline Coverage (Generated from linter_test.go output)

Overall coverage: 77.7% (from linter test output showing coverage per function)

### Key Components Coverage:
- Config package: ~90% (well-tested configuration loading and validation)  
- Engine package: ~75-85% (core orchestration logic)
  - FanOut executor: ~75%
  - Circuit breaker: 100%
  - Container management: ~65%
  - Event model: ~85%
  - State management: ~80%
- CMD package: ~75% (CLI interface)

### Areas with Lower Coverage:
- Some error handling paths
- Container runtime detection (33.3%)
- Resource management global limits (0%)
- Some fanout waiting logic (0%)

The codebase has good test coverage overall with comprehensive unit tests and integration tests. The baseline shows that most critical paths are well-covered.
