# Issue #133 - Test Coverage Tracking

## Baseline Coverage (Start of Implementation)

**Recorded at:** Initial baseline establishment  
**Branch:** feature/133-enable-isolated-child-workflow-execution  
**Date:** $(date)

### Test Results Status
- ✅ Linters (go test -v .)
- ✅ Unit tests ./internal/... 
- ✅ Unit tests ./cmd/tako/...
- ✅ E2E tests --local (all passed in 155.76s)

### Overall Coverage
**Total Coverage: 69.5%**

### Function-Level Coverage Highlights

#### Low Coverage Functions (requiring attention)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/cache.go:60`: newCachePruneCmd (13.3%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:14`: NewExecCmd (18.8%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:133`: handleResumeExecution (0.0%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:140`: determineRepositoryPath (0.0%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/internal/exec.go:157`: printExecutionResult (0.0%)
- `github.com/dangazineu/tako/cmd/tako/main.go:7`: main (0.0%)

#### Engine Package Coverage (target for this issue)
- Various functions in `internal/engine/` with good coverage (mostly 80%+)
- Key areas: runner.go, fanout.go, orchestrator.go

### Coverage Requirements for Implementation
- Overall coverage must not drop below **68.5%** (max 1% decrease)
- Individual function coverage must not drop more than 10% from baseline
- New functions must have adequate test coverage

## Coverage Changes During Implementation

### Phase 1 Completed ✅ - Child Runner Factory
**Status:** All tests passing, workspace isolation working correctly
**New Files Added:**
- `internal/engine/child_runner_factory.go` - Factory implementation
- `internal/engine/child_runner_factory_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite  

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 6 new factory tests with 100% pass rate
- ✅ All existing engine tests continue to pass
- ✅ Workspace isolation verified with concurrent testing (20 goroutines)
- ✅ Cache locking prevents race conditions
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

**Coverage Status:** New code has comprehensive unit test coverage
**Key Achievements:**
- Isolated child workspace creation: `parent/children/<child_run_id>`
- Thread-safe cache locking using existing LockManager
- Factory pattern enables clean Runner instance separation
- Ready for Phase 2 (Child Workflow Executor)

### Phase 2 Completed ✅ - Child Workflow Executor
**Status:** All tests passing, isolated child workflow execution implemented
**New Files Added:**
- `internal/engine/child_workflow_executor.go` - WorkflowRunner implementation
- `internal/engine/child_workflow_executor_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 12 new executor tests with 100% pass rate
- ✅ Security validation for path traversal prevention
- ✅ Repository copying and tako.yml discovery working
- ✅ Workflow input validation with enum support
- ✅ Resource cleanup and error handling verified
- ✅ Type conversion between engine and interface types
- ✅ Engine package coverage increased to 78.6% (+8.8% from Phase 1)

**Coverage Status:** Excellent test coverage for new functionality
**Key Achievements:**
- Implements `interfaces.WorkflowRunner` for dependency injection
- Secure repository path validation prevents attacks
- Supports both local and cached remote repositories
- Tako.yml discovery and validation in child workspaces
- Comprehensive error handling with proper cleanup
- Ready for Phase 3 (Wire Dependency Injection)
