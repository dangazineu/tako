# Baseline Coverage for Hybrid Orchestration Implementation

## Date: 2025-01-08
## Branch: feature/147-add-java-bom-e2e-test
## Commit: 61ab243

## Test Results - All Passing âœ…
- **Unit tests**: PASS
- **Integration tests**: PASS  
- **Linters**: PASS
- **E2E tests** (when run): PASS

## Function Coverage per Package

### internal/config/config.go - Key Functions:
- validateRepoFormat: 0.0% (newly added function, not yet tested)
- validateArtifacts: 0.0% (newly added function, not yet tested)
- validate: 70.6% (main validation function)
- Load: 88.2% (configuration loading)

### internal/graph/graph.go:
- BuildGraph: will need to be updated for dependents support
- Current dependency tree logic uses subscriptions only

### internal/engine/:
- fanout.go: current event-driven implementation
- Will need hybrid orchestration engine

## Next Steps:
1. Update graph resolution to use dependents field
2. Implement hybrid orchestration engine  
3. Test and validate new functionality
4. Update design documentation

## Notes:
- Dependents field and validation functions restored
- All existing tests still pass
- Ready to begin hybrid architecture implementation
