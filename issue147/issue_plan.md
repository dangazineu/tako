# Issue 147 Implementation Plan

## Overview

Complete the Java BOM E2E test orchestration by adding orchestrator control, full chain verification, and ensuring robust integration across all components.

## Phase 1: Orchestrator Implementation

**Goal**: Add centralized orchestrator workflow for release train coordination

### Phase 1.1: Create Orchestrator Repository Template
- Create `test/e2e/templates/java-bom-fanout/orchestrator/` directory
- Add `orchestrator/tako.yml` with release-train workflow
- Implement explicit waiting mechanism (polling java-bom state)
- Add verification of complete chain execution

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Orchestrator workflow triggers core-lib release
- [ ] Orchestrator waits for java-bom completion
- [ ] Orchestrator verifies all repositories completed successfully
- [ ] Codebase compiles and existing tests pass

**Testing**:
- Manual test of orchestrator workflow execution
- Verify orchestrator can poll java-bom state correctly

### Phase 1.2: Update E2E Test Entry Point
- Modify E2E test to use orchestrator as entry point
- Update test case from triggering core-lib directly to triggering orchestrator
- Ensure proper test environment setup for orchestrator

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] E2E test invokes orchestrator workflow
- [ ] Test execution follows orchestrator → core-lib → libs → bom flow
- [ ] All existing test functionality preserved
- [ ] Codebase compiles and existing tests pass

**Testing**:
- Run `java-bom-fanout` E2E test with orchestrator entry point
- Verify test execution completes without errors

## Phase 2: Enhanced Verification and Integration

**Goal**: Complete end-to-end verification and ensure robust mock infrastructure

### Phase 2.1: Complete Chain Verification
- Update E2E test verification to check all 4 repositories
- Add verification for lib-a and lib-b published files
- Add verification for java-bom final state and version files
- Implement pattern matching for dynamic version files

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test verifies core-lib published files exist
- [ ] Test verifies lib-a and lib-b published files exist  
- [ ] Test verifies java-bom published files exist
- [ ] Test verifies java-bom final state contains correct versions
- [ ] All verifications handle dynamic version numbers
- [ ] Codebase compiles and existing tests pass

**Testing**:
- Run complete E2E test and verify all file checks pass
- Test with different version numbers to verify pattern matching

### Phase 2.2: Mock Infrastructure Robustness
- Review mock GitHub server for concurrent operation handling
- Add test state reset mechanism between E2E test runs
- Enhance error handling and logging in mock infrastructure
- Verify mock tools PATH setup is reliable

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Mock server handles concurrent PR creation gracefully
- [ ] Mock server state resets cleanly between test runs
- [ ] Enhanced logging for debugging failed operations
- [ ] Mock tools consistently found in PATH
- [ ] Codebase compiles and existing tests pass

**Testing**:
- Test concurrent PR creation scenarios
- Run multiple E2E test iterations to verify clean state reset
- Verify mock tools function correctly in test environment

## Phase 3: Observability and Debugging

**Goal**: Ensure comprehensive observability for debugging and troubleshooting

### Phase 3.1: Enhanced Logging and Debug Output
- Add debug logging to orchestrator workflow
- Enhance logging in BOM aggregation workflow
- Add timestamp logging for timing analysis
- Ensure E2E test captures and displays relevant logs
- Add explicit error propagation from child workflows to orchestrator
- Implement error reporting for CI failures in lib-a/lib-b

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Orchestrator workflow logs clear progress indicators
- [ ] BOM workflow logs fan-in state transitions
- [ ] All workflows log timing information
- [ ] E2E test displays relevant logs for debugging
- [ ] Debug output helps identify failure points
- [ ] Child workflow errors propagate to orchestrator with clear messages
- [ ] Codebase compiles and existing tests pass

**Testing**:
- Review log output from successful test execution
- Simulate failure scenarios and verify diagnostic information
- Confirm logs provide sufficient information for troubleshooting

### Phase 3.2: Test Cleanup and Robustness
- Implement comprehensive cleanup of temporary artifacts
- Add verification that test cleanup is effective
- Enhance error handling in E2E test framework
- Add timeouts and retry logic where appropriate
- Ensure idempotency of mock operations (restart safety)
- Add negative test cases (e.g., CI failure scenarios)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test cleanup removes all temporary files and directories
- [ ] Mock server data is properly cleaned between runs
- [ ] E2E test handles timeouts gracefully
- [ ] Test framework provides clear error messages
- [ ] Multiple test runs don't interfere with each other
- [ ] Mock operations are idempotent (restart-safe)
- [ ] Negative test cases validate error handling
- [ ] Codebase compiles and existing tests pass

**Testing**:
- Run multiple E2E test iterations to verify cleanup
- Test timeout scenarios and error conditions
- Verify no artifacts remain after test completion

## Phase 4: Final Integration and Validation

**Goal**: Complete end-to-end validation and ensure production readiness

### Phase 4.1: Comprehensive E2E Testing
- Run full test suite including new orchestrator functionality
- Test both local and remote modes
- Verify all repository interactions work correctly
- Validate timing and sequencing across full chain

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All E2E tests pass including java-bom-fanout
- [ ] Test works in both --local and --remote modes
- [ ] Full orchestration chain completes successfully
- [ ] All repositories reach expected final state
- [ ] Timing and sequencing work reliably
- [ ] Codebase compiles and all tests pass

**Testing**:
- Full E2E test suite execution
- Multiple test iterations to verify reliability
- Test in different environments (local vs remote)

### Phase 4.2: Documentation and Polish
- Update existing documentation to reflect orchestrator changes
- Add dedicated section explaining java-bom-fanout orchestrator workflow
- Add comments to complex workflows for maintainability
- Clean up any temporary debug files or unused code
- Ensure code follows project conventions
- Plan CI integration for new orchestrator-driven E2E test

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Workflows are well-commented and maintainable
- [ ] Documentation includes dedicated orchestrator workflow explanation
- [ ] Any new files follow project naming conventions

2. **Centralized Control**: Orchestrator manages timing and coordination  
3. **Complete Verification**: All repositories verified in expected final state
4. **Robust Testing**: E2E test passes reliably in multiple iterations

### Technical Validation
1. **Event Flow**: Events propagate correctly through subscription chain
2. **State Management**: BOM fan-in coordination works reliably
3. **Mock Infrastructure**: PR lifecycle simulation works correctly
4. **Version Handling**: Version propagation and updates work as expected

### Quality Assurance
1. **Test Reliability**: E2E test passes consistently
2. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and failure diagnosis
3. **Cleanup**: No artifacts remain after test completion
4. **Documentation**: Clear implementation and usage documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Concurrent Operations**: Test and verify mock server robustness
- **State Management**: Implement reliable state reset between tests

### Integration Risks  
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Thorough testing of PR lifecycle simulation
- **Environment Setup**: Verify PATH and tool availability consistently
- **Cross-Repository**: Test full chain multiple times

### Quality Risks
- **Test Flakiness**: Add retries and timeout handling where appropriate
- **Debug Difficulty**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- **Maintenance**: Clear documentation and code comments

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing event system and fan-out functionality
- Mock GitHub server and CLI tools
- E2E test framework and verification logic
- Repository templates and workflow definitions

### External Dependencies
- Git operations for repository management

- File system operations for state management
- Network operations for mock server communication

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (Orchestrator implementation)
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 days (Enhanced verification and integration)  
- **Phase 3**: 1 day (Observability and debugging)
- **Phase 4**: 1 day (Final integration and validation)

**Total**: 4-6 days

This timeline assumes no major architectural changes are needed and builds incrementally on the existing solid foundation.
